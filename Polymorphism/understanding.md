Polymorphism in Python means "many forms," where a single method or function behaves differently based on the object calling it.

Types of Polymorphism in Python:

Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic):
Achieved through method overriding.
A parent class defines a method, and a child class redefines it with the same name and signature.
At runtime, the method called depends on the object's actual class

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "I make a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

obj = Dog()  # Run-time decision: calls Dog's speak()
print(obj.speak())  # Output: Woof!
obj = Cat()  # Run-time decision: calls Cat's speak()
print(obj.speak())  # Output: Meow!


Compile-time Polymorphism (Static):
Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.
Python does not support method overloading directly (like Java/C++), as it allows only one method with a given name in a class. However, you can simulate it using default arguments or variable-length arguments.
Operator overloading (e.g., using __add__ for +) is supported.









Your understanding of polymorphism in Python is mostly correct, but let me clarify and provide a crisp, clear explanation:

**Polymorphism** in Python means "many forms," where a single method or function behaves differently based on the object calling it. It allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly.

### Types of Polymorphism in Python:
1. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic)**:
   - Achieved through **method overriding**.
   - A parent class defines a method, and a child class redefines it with the same name and signature.
   - At runtime, the method called depends on the object's actual class (not the reference type).
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def speak(self):
             return "I make a sound"
     
     class Dog(Animal):
         def speak(self):
             return "Woof!"
     
     class Cat(Animal):
         def speak(self):
             return "Meow!"
     
     obj = Dog()  # Run-time decision: calls Dog's speak()
     print(obj.speak())  # Output: Woof!
     obj = Cat()  # Run-time decision: calls Cat's speak()
     print(obj.speak())  # Output: Meow!
     ```

2. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static)**:
   - Achieved through **method overloading** or **operator overloading**.
   - Python **does not support method overloading** directly (like Java/C++), as it allows only one method with a given name in a class. However, you can simulate it using default arguments or variable-length arguments.
   - Operator overloading (e.g., using `__add__` for `+`) is supported.
   - Example (Operator Overloading):
     ```python
     class Point:
         def __init__(self, x):
             self.x = x
         
         def __add__(self, other):
             return Point(self.x + other.x)
     
     p1 = Point(2)
     p2 = Point(3)
     p3 = p1 + p2  # Calls __add__
     print(p3.x)  # Output: 5
     ```

### Key Points:
- Python primarily relies on **run-time polymorphism** via inheritance and method overriding.
- **Compile-time polymorphism** (like method overloading) isn’t natively supported but can be mimicked.
- The decision of which method to call in run-time polymorphism is made dynamically based on the object’s type at runtime.

Your understanding of run-time polymorphism is spot-on: the method called is determined by the object’s class at runtime. For compile-time, just note Python’s limitations with method overloading.

**Crisp Line**: Polymorphism in Python allows a single method to take many forms, primarily through run-time method overriding or operator overloading, as Python doesn’t directly support compile-time method overloading.






Can you show polymorphism without inheritance?

Yes! In Python, duck typing allows polymorphism without inheritance.
If two unrelated classes implement the same method name, I can call that method on any object — Python doesn't care about the class, only if the method exists.


class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof")

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow")

def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

d1=Dog()
c1=Cat()
animals = [d1, c1]

for animal in animals:
    animal_sound(animal)



Can you give a real-life example of polymorphism?
A:
Sure! Think of a remote_control object. Whether it's for a TV, AC, or projector, the press_power() button works — but each device behaves differently.
In my code python-oops-practise/day5_poly.py, I used a similar idea: each Hero had a taunt() method, but each taunt was unique to the hero.




How did you implement polymorphism in your OOP game project?
A:
I created a base class Hero with methods like display_stats() and taunt(). Then, each subclass (Knight, Mage, etc.) overrode taunt() to give their unique response.
When I looped through a list of different heroes and called taunt(), each one gave a different output — demonstrating polymorphism in a clean, scalable way.
